Description: Tools, methods and processes for the management 
  of analysis workflows. These lightweight solutions facilitate 
  structuring R&D activities. These solutions were developed to comply with FAIR 
  principles as discussed by Jacobsen et al. (2017) <doi:10.1162/dint_r_00024>, 
  and with ALCOA+ principles as proposed by the U.S. FDA.
